# Advent of Code 2021

My AOC 2021 efforts. I laughed, I cried, I mostly caused Go fatal stack overflows through poorly implemented recursion.

Needed some small reddit hints on Day 19, some bigger ones on Day 24 but apart from that managed to work my way through eventually. 
Had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Whenever I need to cheer myself up  I just  go back and run my Day 22 test cases.
